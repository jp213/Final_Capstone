# Final_Capstone
Final Thinkful Data Science Program Capstone

This research project consists of 6 Jupyter Notebooks, each pertaining to a particular phase in the process. Names begin with 'FC_NFP_', which simply stands for Final Capstone NetFlix Prize. Below is a brief description of each notebook.

* 01_Overview: provides an introduction and backround of the Netflix Prize, begins working with data
* 02_Feature_Engineering: discusses reasons behind engineering new features, and several features are created
* 03_Correlation_and_Splits: examines correlations between variables, where it is demonstrated that correlations between the engineered features and the target variable are remarkably stronger than the basic given features that Netflix provided
* 04_Dimsionality_Reduction: seeks to utilize an unsupervised learning technique either to reduce computational cost, or improve prediction accuracy
* 05_Distributions-and-Transformations: (self-explanatory)
* 06_Models: takes another look at the Netflix Prize, then demonstrates linear, gradient descent, and tree models; presents conclusion
